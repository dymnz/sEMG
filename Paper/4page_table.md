1. Introduction
    * Wrist angle
    * EMG signal application
        - prothetic, VR, exo-skeleton
    * EMG signal acquisition
        - Invasive v.s. Non-invasive (sEMG)
    * The need for sEMG signal separation
    * Neural Network
        - ANN
        - RNN
2. Methodology
    * RMS
        - Extract sEMG signal power
    * nICA
    * TDSEP
    * LSTM
        - Architecture
3. Experiment Protocol
    * Hardware/Software setup
        - Active electrode (Pre-amp)
        - LPF / HPF / Inv-Amp / Level shifter
        - Matlab / Processing
    * Subjects
        - age / weight / height
    * Experiment procedure
        - 3rd*20seg of FLX/EXT/PRO/SUP w/ 4/6-ch in 2/3 pos.
