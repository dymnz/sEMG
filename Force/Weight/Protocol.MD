### Luggage scale - Angle - sEMG


#### Placement
1. On forearm: Palm up, extension of middle finger, 7cm to elbow
2. On Bicep: Palm up, extension of middle finger, line up with former, 3 cm to elbow

#### Trial
1. 90d zero-load
2. Fixed angle, varying load

#### Observe
1. 90d zero-load normalization
2. Angle's effect on Weight-sEMG curve, angle-sEMG curve
    * Angle's effect on sEMG should be a constant multiplier
