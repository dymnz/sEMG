## Experiment 5 - 2017/8/29

### sEMG-Force relationship @90/135 degree
* 2 sessions at the same day
* 90d first, 135d later

### Findings

session average amp. (DC removed):
1. 0.132898
2. 0.130468
Difference < 2%

sEMG amplitude @90d is smaller than 135d, expected.

### Conclusion
* Elbow angle's effect on sEMG seems to be constant weight, that's why the curvature is the same accross test
