## Experiment 3 - 2017/8/9


### Inter-session: sEMG-Force Relationship
* 1kg ~ 4kg
* 20 seconds experiment.
* 20~30 min between test
* Normalize the result with MVC of each session

### Weight - MAV(ProcessedData) / MAV(ProcessedMVC)


W/o MVC nomalization:

```
Last session (session 1):
1kg - 0.5006
2kg - 0.7708
3kg - 1.1663
4kg - 1.7584
MVC - 0.8113


This session (session 2):
1kg - 0.2446
2kg - 0.3507
3kg - 0.5602
4kg - 0.5688
MVC - 0.8113
```

W/ MVC nomalization:

```
Last session (session 1):
1kg - 0.2390
2kg - 0.3680
3kg - 0.5568
4kg - 0.8395
MVC - 1.0

This session (session 2):
1kg - 0.1715
2kg - 0.2459
3kg - 0.3928
4kg - 0.5688
MVC - 1.0
```

### Plot

W/ MVC nomalization:

The result is non-linear

---

### Thoughts
* The curve is clearly different, why?
* Re-test on 3kg:

---

* The curve looks the same. Also, there's a constant ratio relationship between individual tests.

---

* Multiply each sample by the mean(ratio accorss tests), session2/session1: 
	* W/ MVC nomalization: 0.6921
	* W/o MVC nomalization: 0.4713

Perfect match! 


However,

```
MVC1 = 2.0945 
MVC2 = 1.4264

MVC2 / MVC1 = 0.681
EMG_2 / EMG_1
	= Ratio_21
	= 0.4713
```
**Why (EMG_2 / EMG_1) != (MVC2 / MVC1) ?**

i.e. Ratio_21 !=  MVC2 / MVC1


```
MVCnorm_EMG_1 = EMG_1 / MVC_1
MVCnorm_EMG_2 = EMG_2 / MVC_2

Ratio_21
	= EMG_2 / EMG_1
	= 0.4713 (From test)

MVCnorm_Ratio_21
	= MVCnorm_EMG_2 / MVCnorm_EMG_1
	= (EMG_2 / MVC_2) / (EMG_1 / MVC_1)
	= (EMG_2 / EMG_1) * (MVC_1 / MVC_2)
	= Ratio_21 / (MVC2 / MVC1)
	= 0.4713 / 0.681 (From test)
	= 0.6921 (Matches test)

When (Ratio_21) ==  (MVC2 / MVC1)
--> MVCnorm_Ratio_21 = 1
```
**Maybe MVC test isn't done properly?**



### Conclusion
* The inter-session sEMG-Force curve does not change
	* The difference of parameter accorss sessions includes:
		* Pre-Amp gain
		* Electrode placement
		* The test subject's condition

* Since the curve does not change, other than the ratio, we can use only **1** sample to estimate the ratio, and apply it on the modeled curve to estimate the force output.
	* Or, maybe, if the MVC test is performed correcty, no calibration with weight is required
