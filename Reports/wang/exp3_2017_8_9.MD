## Experiment 3 - 2017/8/9


### Inter-session: sEMG-Force Relationship
* 1kg ~ 4kg
* 20 seconds experiment.
* 20~30 min between test
* Normalize the result with MVC of each session

### Weight - mean(abs(ProcessedData)) / mean(abs(ProcessedMVC))
```
Last session (session 1):
1kg - 0.1715
2kg - 0.2459
3kg - 0.2719
4kg - 0.5688

This session (session 2):
1kg - 0.2390
2kg - 0.3680
3kg - 0.5568
4kg - 0.8395
```


### Plot

The result is non-linear


### Thoughts
* The curve is clearly different, why?
* Re-test on 3kg:

* The curve looks the same. Also, there's a constant weight relationship between individual tests.

* Multiply each sample by the mean(weight constant accorss tests):

Perfect match!

### Conclusion
* The inter-session sEMG-Force curve does not change
	* The difference of parameter accorss sessions includes:
		* Pre-Amp gain
		* Electrode placement
		* The test subject's condition

* Since the curve does not change, other than the weight constant, we can use only **1** sample to estimate the weight, and apply it on the modeled curve to estimate the force output.
