## Experiment 3 - 2017/8/9


### Inter-session: sEMG-Force Relationship
* 1kg ~ 4kg
* 20 seconds experiment.
* 20~30 min between test
* Normalize the result with MVC of each session

### Weight - MAV(ProcessedData) / MAV(ProcessedMVC)
```
Last session (session 1):
1kg - 0.1715
2kg - 0.2459
3kg - 0.2719
4kg - 0.5688
MVC - 2.361754


This session (session 2):
1kg - 0.2390
2kg - 0.3680
3kg - 0.5568
4kg - 0.8395
MVC - 1.936594
```

### Plot

W/ MVC nomalization:

The result is non-linear

---

### Thoughts
* The curve is clearly different, why?
* Re-test on 3kg:

* The curve looks the same. Also, there's a constant ratio relationship between individual tests.

* Multiply each sample by the mean(ratio accorss tests), session2/session1, 0.6921 in this case:

Perfect match! 

However
```
MVC1 = 2.361754 
MVC2 = 1.936594

MVC2/MVC1 = 0.819981251
```
**MVC test not performed correctly?**

### Conclusion
* The inter-session sEMG-Force curve does not change
	* The difference of parameter accorss sessions includes:
		* Pre-Amp gain
		* Electrode placement
		* The test subject's condition

* Since the curve does not change, other than the ratio, we can use only **1** sample to estimate the ratio, and apply it on the modeled curve to estimate the force output.
