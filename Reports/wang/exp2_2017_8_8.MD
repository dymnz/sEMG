## Experiment 2 - 2017/8/8


### sEMG-Force Relationship
* 1kg ~ 4kg
* 20 seconds experiment.
* 20~30 min between test

### Signal Pre-processing
* ProcessedData =  Data - mean(Data)

### Weight - mean(abs(ProcessedData))
* 1kg - 0.500559
* 2kg - 0.770838
* 3kg - 1.166261
* 4kg - 1.758366

The result is non-linear


### Thoughts
* Since the experiment is a vertical setup (i.e. the force is generated by gravity), under NO condition will the bicep output ZERO force, since the forearm generates weight as well. The forearm acts as a constant weight.
* Because of the above, the weight Weight-sEMG relationship should be modified: 
```
N + 1kg - 0.500559
N + 2kg - 0.770838
N + 3kg - 1.166261
N + 4kg - 1.758366
```

* Electrode placement should be adjusted. In this experiment, the electrode is at the lower half of the bicep.
* The data, mean(abs(ProcessedData)), should be normalized by MVC.
