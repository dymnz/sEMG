## Experiment 4 - 2017/8/24

### Acce elbow angle estimation

### Steps
1. Bias removal of each accelerometer
2. Calculate roll/pitch using eq.37/38 in [Freescale document](http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN3461.pdf)
3. Calulate the angle using the pitch date from both accelerometer ![pic placeholder](https://github.com/dymnz/sEMG/blob/master/Reports/wang/pics/exp4_2017_8_24/angle_calc.png)

### Findings
1. Accelerometer can have very good estimation of roll/pitch (~1 degree error)
2. [Need proof]: A bit of axis misalignment on the roll axis is fine, but alignment preferred


### Conclusion
* Elbow angle estimation will not be accurate due to the muscle on the arm, i.e. no ground truth available
* The closest thing to having a ground truth is to have accelerometers placed at the exact same spot every experiment: see [protocol](https://github.com/dymnz/sEMG/blob/master/Force/Weight/Protocol.MD)
