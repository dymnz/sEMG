### Wrist Movements
* DOF - 1 (Pitch):
  * Flexion: Palm facing down, moving **downward**
  * Extension: Palm facing down, moving **upward**
* DOF - 2 (Roll):
  * Pronation: Forearm turning **counter-clockwise**
    * ["pronation involves placing the palms into the prone (**face-down**) position, like someone would do when looking at the backs of their hands"](http://www.innerbody.com/image/musc03.html)
  * Supination: Forearm turning **clockwise**
    * ["The motion of supination turns the palms anteriorly or superiorly to the supine (**face-up**) position."](http://www.innerbody.com/image/musc03.html)
    * *In the anatomical position, with the arms extended to the sides of the trunk and palms facing forward, the arms are already in the supinated position.*
* DOF - 3 (Yaw):
  * Radial Deviation: Palm moving **counter-clockwise** on the **horizontal plane**
  * Ulnar Deviation: Palm moving **clockwise** on the **horizontal plane**
