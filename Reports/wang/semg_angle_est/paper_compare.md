      *placed around the thickest part of the forearm (approximately 1/3
      distally from the elbow), equi-spaced in a circle around the
      forearm, similarly to [11,14].
      Equi-spaced electrode place-
      ment was used, rather than targeting at specific muscles,
      because **7 electrode pairs provided necessary coverage of
      the area of interest*, as shown in previous studies [14,15]**
