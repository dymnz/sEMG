## Experiment 6 - 2017/8/30

### sEMG-Force relationship @105 degree comparing with 90/135d
* 1 sessions at the same day
* 90d 0kg first, 135d 1~4kg later

### Findings

Composite graph of 90/105/135d fit the expected result

### Data testing
Define: 
* 90d_0kg calibration 
* nd_1~4kg test

1. Show that calibration ratio accross various angle fits the ration between test
2. Plot the curve of: ratio w.r.t angle

---

### Thoughts 
1. Is angle < 90d possible using gravity as load? 
2. Is the angle estimation accurate enough to plot ratio-angle plot?

### Conclusion
