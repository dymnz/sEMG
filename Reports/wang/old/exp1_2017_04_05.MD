## Experiment 1 - 2017/4/5

### Result
* #### Arduino <--> MatLab communication
    * Communication via serial port with batch reading
    * MatLab FFT checked
    * Current sampling rate ~10KHz

### Notes

* #### Sampling rate change
```   
    ADC->CTRLB.reg = ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV128 |   // Divide Clock by 64.
                        ADC_CTRLB_RESSEL_12BIT;       // Result on 12 bits
```

Settings:
```
ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV512  ~10k s/sec
ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV256  ~20k s/sec
ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV128  ~33k s/sec
ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV64   ~50k s/sec
ADC_CTRLB_PRESCALER_DIV16   ~80k s/sec
```
*Why though?*

* #### Sending Data
Serial.print is very slow, largely affects sampling rate.
The proper usage is to read a lot of samples and send them at once.
`BatchSend(MaxSampleCount)`

* #### Outputs are stable with sampling rate upto 10kHz(other sampling rate not tested)

* #### AREF should be connected to onboard 5V 

### Issue

* #### Need to align `BatchSend()` with MatLab, so that the data isn't cut off.
Send a character to Arduino to start gathering samples.

* #### Dynamic memory
Aruino M0 PRO has 32KB SRAM
```
-> 2B per sample 
-> 16K samples at most
@10KHz sampling rate, 1.6s of sample time
```
Needs delay between samples to drive the sampling rate down.

### Next
* Gather output from sEMG
   * Levelshifter required
