## Experiment 7 - 2017/9/12

### sEMG-Force relationship @120 degree
* 1 session, gain adjusted
* 90d 0kg first, 120d 1~4kg later


### Wireless Acce prototype
* Supply power: 
  - Bluetooth >5v  
  - MPU 3 ~ 5v
  - MCU 3 ~ 12v
  
Decided to use "3v Lithium battery(Sony CR2032)" x2

#### Result
* Lithium battery x2 ~= 5.2V after connection (should be 6V); battery life is short; voltage is not stable.

#### Fix
* Sony CR2032 Standard Discharge Current. 0.2mA. Source.
* Need at least 8 + 10mA(Bluetooth/Atmega328)
