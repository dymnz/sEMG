### The Application of sEMG in Aging : A Mini Review

#### "This short review aims to briefly inform the reader of the latest developments in this field and to provide possible applications of interest in aging"


### Keypoint        
* Device
    - Bipolar configuration: Easy and fase 
    - Linear electrode arrays: Locate IZ and measure CV
    - bidimensional electrodes: More data
* Electrode placement
    - **Electrodes must be placed between the IZ and tendon terminations** to assure the recording of meaningful signals. 
    - **Traditional bipolar configuration needs electrodes to be placed parallel to muscle fiber** and such a position can be carefully obtained by checking for the highest EMG signal amplitude. 
* sEMG amplitude
    - It is well known that the **larger the requested force output, the greater the amplitude of the sEMG signal** [1]. 
    - The most common descriptors of sEMG signal amplitude are the **average rectified value and the root mean square value**. 
    - However, **the relation between force exerted and sEMG amplitude is not necessarily linear since a number of confounding factors influence the raw sEMG signal recorded over the skin**, e.g. the amplitude cancellation, which is the cancellation of positive and negative phases of MUAPs, and the distribution of active MUs within the muscle, among others [9].
* sEMG frequency
    - The power spectrum of EMG signal is in the **frequency range of 10–400 Hz**.
    - The **frequency content of the signal** is generally considered to be related to the recruitment of different MU types on the base of the following scheme: **the faster the recruited MUs, the higher the mean/median frequency of the recorded signal**.   
    - a recent debate described a **number of confounding factors** (fiber length, depth of MU within the volume conductor, volume conductor low-pass filtering effect, etc.) which **prevent claiming that spectral properties of the sEMG signal can provide information about MU recruitment and muscle fiber type [20]**. 
* Fatigue
    - During sustained fatiguing con- tractions the **power spectrum changes as a sign of myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue**.
    - ...**when only bipolar configuration is available, spectral variables can be used to provide an overall index of muscle fatigue**. When **multichannel sEMG** is available, **muscle fiber CV should be preferred to spectral variables**. 
    - The **rate of decrease of power spectrum parameters has been observed to be greater in young people than in elderly people during submaximal isometric contractions** in many experimental setups [19].  
* Aging
    - The **decrease of neuromuscular power and rate of force development with age** have been shown to have severe consequences, such as **increasing the risk of fall and disability, and decreasing autonomy maintenance** [13].
    - **Maximal muscle strength, power, and rate of force development decrease with aging**. The absolute value of sEMG amplitude during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) shows the same trend, being lower in elderly compared with young and middle-aged adults [10] ...
    - ... These differences are related to **lower MU recruitment and discharge rates**, but the roles played by these two features cannot be distinguished with bipolar sEMG [9].
    - In fact, it has been demonstrated that in **elderly people functional performance is more related to neuromuscular power than to maximal muscle strength**.
    - ... **the decrease in muscle power with age is bigger than the decrease in maximal strength** ... There are many fundamental motor tasks which have reported this kind of decrease, such as concentric contractions, explosive isometric contractions, and jumps. This is **due to a decrease in maximal discharge frequency of MUs and in the percentage of MUs which exhibit doublets (i.e. a double discharge at intervals <5 ms) [15]**.
*  Subcutaneous adipose tissue 
    - **The thickness of subcutaneous fat layers should be measured with ultrasound imaging.** Only when these measures are the same between populations is it possible to compare the absolute values of sEMG amplitude estimates. **Otherwise only relative variations can be meaningfully detected.**
    - For example **normalizing the sEMG amplitude obtained during submaximal contractions with respect to the amplitude obtained during an MVC can provide an estimate of the relative muscle activation**[2].
* Training
    - A number of studies have documented that **strength training elicits significant changes in muscle strength in elderly individuals**, even in subjects over 90 years of age. The **maximal strength gains is accompanied by significant increases in sEMG amplitude of the agonist muscles**, recorded in both isometric and dynamic actions, suggesting an increase in the magnitude of voluntary neuromuscular activity [12]. 
    -  It is well documented that **maximal muscle power increases after strength training in elderly subjects [16]. These training adaptations produce an increase in sEMG amplitude [11]**. 
    -  In response to **progressive resistance training, both young and elderly subjects exhibit increased levels of magnitude and onset-rate sEMG in the initial 200 ms of rapid contractions** [17]. These modifications represent an **increase in rapid MU firing, an earlier recruitment of MUs, and probably also an augmented MU synchronization**.

　   
### Word
* Innervation zone (IZ): The physical region where the motor neuron termi- nations and muscle fibers systems connect through the neuromuscular junctions (or end plates). From there, **action potentials travel in opposite directions toward the tendon terminations** and generate propagating potentials over the skin. ***Worst site to place a pair of recording electrodes***
* Conduction velocity (CV): Velocity of EMG signal propagates through muscle
* Subcutaneous adipose tissue: 皮下脂肪組織
* Agonist: 主動肌
* Antagonist: 拮抗肌
* Muscle power: Power is defined as the ability to generate as much force as fast as possible
* Muscle strength: Strength is the amount of force a muscle, or group of muscles, can exert against and external load.
