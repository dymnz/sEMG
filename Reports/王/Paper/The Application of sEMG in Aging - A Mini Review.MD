### The Application of sEMG in Aging : A Mini Review

#### "This short review aims to briefly inform the reader of the latest developments in this field and to provide possible applications of interest in aging"


### Keypoint
* Device
    - Bipolar configuration: Easy and fase
    - Linear electrode arrays: Locate IZ and measure CV
    - bidimensional electrodes: More data
* Electrode placement
    - Electrodes must be placed between the IZ and tendon terminations to assure the recording of meaningful signals. 
    - Traditional bipolar configuration needs electrodes to be placed parallel to muscle fiber and such a position can be carefully obtained by checking for the highest EMG signal amplitude.

### Word
* Innervation zone (IZ): The physical region where the motor neuron termi- nations and muscle fibers systems connect through the neuromuscular junctions (or end plates). From there, **action potentials travel in opposite directions toward the tendon terminations** and generate propagating potentials over the skin. ***Worst site to place a pair of recording electrodes***
* Conduction velocity (CV): Velocity of EMG signal propagates through muscle
