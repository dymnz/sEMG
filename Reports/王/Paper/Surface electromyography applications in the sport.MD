### Surface electromyography applications in the sport

#### General introduction to the application and sEMG with some interesting reference

#### 7/10

### Keypoint
* sEMG & force
  - The degree of muscular activity which itself reflects the level of muscular effort. **However, this must not be confused with the level of muscular force, as the electrical signal detected is a function of the ionic concentration in the muscle.**
  - It has to be remembered that the **EMG does not provide us with muscular force parameters, although it is an indicator of the muscular effort made in a particular action**. 
* Electrode placement
  - It is very important to **always use the same position on different individuals and for different recordings taken from the same individual**, given that the signal recorded varies according to the area of the muscle on which the electrodes are positioned. 
  - ... a **reference electrode has to be positioned far from the recording area and on electrically neutral tissue.** For this, areas close to a bone plane(?) are usually chosen, such as for example the tibial diaphysis or the cubital styloids in the wrist.
* Pope et al carried out a study of the extensor musculature of the vertebral column at level L3,  finding that the **wavelet detects the variations in muscular activity over time better than FFT**.
* sEMG signal processing
  - ... in situations of **fatigue through prolonged effort, where the spectrum tends to be displaced towards the left on the graph, to lower frequency** values.
* sEMG in general
  - A change in the relative position of the muscle in relation to the electrode means that the same spatial relationship is not maintained between them, which affects the intensity of the signal that is recorded. **Because of this, the best conditions for carrying out an SEMG, depending on the use and application required, are those that are similar to those needed for an isometric type of study**

### Word
* sEMG: AKA kinesiological electromyography


### General
* Different muscle activation pattern between Ramp and Ballistic
* Ballistic RFD > Ramp RFD

### Spinoff
* Effects of rate of force development on EMG amplitude and frequency
