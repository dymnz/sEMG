### Spectral properties of the surface EMG can characterize/do not provide information about motor unit recruitment strategies and muscle fiber type

#### Nice opening with definitions.

### Keypoint  
* Recruitment pattern:  
    - **A pulse train in the motoneurons is generated by the central nervous system activating the muscle fibers** through the neuromuscular end plates. The fibers belonging to one motoneuron form a motor unit (MU). 
    - The recruitment pattern indicates which MUs are selected and by what pulse train they are activated. **Modern technologies allow detecting the rate coding pattern of a pulse train (9)**.
    - **Rate-coding patterns controlling the intensity of the EMG do not coincide in time with the selection of MUs (17)**.
    - The **recruitment strategy changes the recruitment pattern** over time and controls force and timing of MUs required to perform the task at hand.
* Muscle tasks:  
    - **Specific muscle fibers will be used for specific tasks** like lock and hold, lock and release, pull and release (length change), and reflex tasks. **The task-specific MU groups will most likely show different power spectra indicating when a different group has been recruited**.

### We obtained a modeled EMG by convolving these MUAPs with a pulse train of  -pulses. Our model computations and results from other publications show the following:
1. A temporal MUAP reflects a spatial MUAP rescaled by the conduction velocity.
    * Make sense 
2. The power spectrum depends on the shape of the MUAP (7).
    * Of course
3. The shape of a MUAP is determined by the size of the end plate zone and the end plate distribution. The fine structure of the MUAP is mainly contained at higher frequencies.
    * ???
    * Of course
4. The energy of the power spectrum is equal to the integrated EMG squared.
    *  Isn't that the definition?
5. The energy increases linearly with the number of identical MUAPs. There is no amplitude cancellation by overlapping MUAPs (3).
    * **Read paper [3]**
6. The pulse train, whether repetitive or random, adds noise to the MUAP’s power spectrum.
    * Of course
7. The filtered power spectrum represents a weighted overlay of the power spectra of the selected MUs (11).
    * 
8. Synchronization downshifts the power spectrum.
    *
9. Time resolution limits frequency resolution (6).

### Word
* Fiber type, type I/II muscle: Fast/slow twitch muscle, classified based on the rate of myofibrilar ATPase reaction
* **[Rate coding pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Rate_coding)**: The rate coding model of neuronal firing communication states that as the intensity of a stimulus increases, the frequency or rate of action potentials, or "spike firing", increases. Rate coding is sometimes called frequency coding. **Rate coding is a traditional coding scheme, assuming that most, if not all, information about the stimulus is contained in the firing rate of the neuron.**
