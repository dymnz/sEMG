### The extraction of neural strategies from the surface EMG: an update

#### Citation > 1000, fundamental analysis of sEMG neural drive extraction. Contains simulation of "Amplitude cancelation" and "Ramp contraction recruitment"

#### 8/10

### Keypoint
* Fatigue Keypoint
    1. Lower mean frequency
    2. May have more motor unit recruitment, but less force output

* sEMG frequency 
    * ...the difference between a surface action potential generated by a motor unit with relatively high conduction velocity (high threshold) and that generated by a motor unit with lower conduction velocity (lower threshold) may be compensated by a different average distance between the two motor units and the recording electrodes (volume conductor effect) 
    * Despite significant modulation of motor unit activity during the ramp contractions, the instantaneous mean frequency of the EMG remained relatively constant.
    
* Fatigue
    * conduction velocity decreased during the sustained contraction and there was a greater amount of motor unit activity during the ramp contraction after the fatiguing contraction
    * the instantaneous mean frequency was lower after the fatiguing contraction despite the greater amount of motor unit activity
