### Effects of rate of force development on EMG amplitude and frequency

#### To compare the median frequency and amplitude of Ramp/Ballistic contraction sEMG

### Word

* Gastrocnemius muscle: Meaning "stomach of leg"
* RFD: Rate of force development
* Ramp contraction: Build up torque in 2-3 sec and hold at max for 2-3 sec
* Ballistic contracion: No build up, max force hold for 2-3 sec
* Isotonic contractions: Generate force by changing the length of the muscle and can be concentric contractions or eccentric contractions.
* Isometric contractions: Generate force without changing the length of the muscle.
* Median frequency: Frequency that splits the power spectrum into two equal parts
* MVC? CNS?

### General
* Different muscle activation pattern between Ramp and Ballistic

* Ballistic RFD >

### Ramp contraction
* Asynchronized MU recruitment
* EMG amplitude increases linearly with force
* Size principle
* Amplitude and frequency increase linearly with isometric force


### Ballistic contraction
* Synchronized MU recruitment
* Synchronization increase frequency, decrease amplitude on sEMG
* Higher max amplitude
* 

### Note
* Gain=1000, -3dB: 16~500, 1kHz ADC
* Max Vpp = 1mV
