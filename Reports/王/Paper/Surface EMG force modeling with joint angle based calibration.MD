### Surface EMG force modeling with joint angle based calibration

#### sEMG force esitmation: "In this work, a sub-maximal calibration procedure is developed to compensate for changes in joint angle – which in turn cause changes in muscle length, muscle moment arm and IZ shift - thereby achieving an improved SEMG–force model for flexion–extension contractions of the elbow over a range of elbow joint angles.", "The method is developed for single-site SEMG recordings."

### Keypoint 
* Force model
    * Parametric modeling approaches often use Hill’s muscle model, which explicitly incorporates muscle and joint dynamics, including the muscle force–length relationship and moment arm.
    * The force–length relationship for the biceps brachii has an in- verted-U shape (Bechtel and Caldwell, 1994; Leedham and Dowling, 1995) and the relationship for several upper limb mus- cles has been modeled as a Gaussian function (Cavallaro et al., 2006).
    * Hill muscle model, muscle force is the sum of the contractile element force (FCE) and the parallel elastic element force (FPE) 
    
* Electrode placement
    * ...electrode placement has an effect on the SEMG amplitude and suggested that the effect of IZ shift on SEMG amplitude is reduced by normalization with respect to the highest recorded value for each subject.
    * ...proximity of the recording electrodes to the IZ results in inconsistency in the estimated force–SEMG relationship. Multi- electrode SEMG recordings can be used to compensate for this

### Word
* Biceps brachii: 二頭肌

### General
* Fast orthogonal search (FOS), a time do- main method for rapid non-linear identification, was used to gen- erate SEMG–force models, using both non-calibrated and calibrated SEMG amplitude data. 
* Hill muscle model equations for the SEMG–force relation- ship are used to explain the concept of the proposed calibration method for a single muscle, in this case, the **biceps brachii**.
