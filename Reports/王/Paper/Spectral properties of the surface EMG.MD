### Spectral properties of the surface EMG can characterize/do not provide information about motor unit recruitment strategies and muscle fiber type

#### Nice opening with definitions. Insights on sEMG muscle recruitment and spectral proprety.

### Conclusion (quotes)
The major statements of this publication are that 

1. Muscle activities are task dependent
2. Task-dependent spectral changes can be observed if the tasks actually change
3. Power-spectral changes are associated with changes in the selected muscle fiber types.

**...one should not expect to see substantial changes in power spectra when studying single-task experiments such as an isometric
ramped increase in force (4), selective recruitment of fasttwitch muscle fibers during lengthening contractions (2), and/or EMG activity during an explosive contraction (8).** 

The statement can explain the result of [Effects of rate of force development on EMG amplitude and frequency](https://github.com/dymnz/sEMG/blob/master/Reports/%E7%8E%8B/Paper/Effects%20of%20rate%20of%20force%20development%20on%20EMG%20amplitude%20and%20frequency.MD)

**Furthermore, one should expect controversial results in the power spectra when studying activities where synergistic activation of MUs is produced (8) because synergistic activities will downshift the power spectrum. Thus single tasks and synergistic experiments are not suited to reveal or reject changes in spectral properties resulting from changes in recruitment pattern. Single-task and synergistic experiments do provide insight in the modulations affecting spectra during individual muscle tasks.**

Need to check what causes synergistic activities.

### Keypoint  
* Recruitment pattern:  
    * **A pulse train in the motoneurons is generated by the central nervous system activating the muscle fibers** through the neuromuscular end plates. The fibers belonging to one motoneuron form a motor unit (MU). 
    * The recruitment pattern indicates which MUs are selected and by what pulse train they are activated. **Modern technologies allow detecting the rate coding pattern of a pulse train (9)**.
    * **Rate-coding patterns controlling the *intensity of the EMG* do not coincide in time with the *selection of MUs* (17)**.
    * The **recruitment strategy changes the recruitment pattern** over time and controls force and timing of MUs required to perform the task at hand.
* Muscle tasks:  
    * **Specific muscle fibers will be used for specific tasks** like lock and hold, lock and release, pull and release (length change), and reflex tasks. **The task-specific MU groups will most likely show different power spectra indicating when a different group has been recruited**.
* Signal:
    * **Power spectra of EMG signals depend primarily on the task** and are **subsequently modulated by factors such as length change, lactate accumulation, and volume conduction**.
    

### We obtained a modeled EMG by convolving these MUAPs with a pulse train of impulses. Our model computations and results from other publications show the following:
   **Similar to a model in speech generation, copy-and-paste**

1. A temporal MUAP reflects a spatial MUAP rescaled by the conduction velocity.
    * Make sense 
2. The power spectrum depends on the shape of the MUAP (7).
    * Of course
3. The shape of a MUAP is determined by the size of the end plate zone and the end plate distribution. The fine structure of the MUAP is mainly contained at higher frequencies.
    * ???
    * Of course
4. The energy of the power spectrum is equal to the integrated EMG squared.
    *  Isn't that the definition?
5. The energy increases linearly with the number of identical MUAPs. There is no amplitude cancellation by overlapping MUAPs (3).
    * **Read paper [3]**
6. The pulse train, whether repetitive or random, adds noise to the MUAPâ€™s power spectrum.
    * Of course
7. The filtered power spectrum represents a weighted overlay of the power spectra of the selected MUs (11).
    * Of course
8. Synchronization downshifts the power spectrum.
    * Frequency downshifts, makes sense
9. Time resolution limits frequency resolution (6).

    ### Word
    
* Fiber type, type II/I muscle: Fast/slow twitch muscle, classified based on the rate of myofibrilar ATPase reaction (The paper is misleading)
* **[Rate coding pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Rate_coding)**: The rate coding model of neuronal firing communication states that as the intensity of a stimulus increases, the frequency or rate of action potentials, or "spike firing", increases. Rate coding is sometimes called frequency coding. **Rate coding is a traditional coding scheme, assuming that most, if not all, information about the stimulus is contained in the firing rate of the neuron.**
