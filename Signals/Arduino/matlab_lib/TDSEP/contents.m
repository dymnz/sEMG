% This is a simple and efficient MATLAB implementation of blind source separation.
% Along the lines of Schuster and Molgedey [1] two (lagged) correlation matrices
% are computed and diagonalized simultaneously using MATLAB's  general eigen-problem solver
% (eig.m). The big problem with this approach is to determine the optimal lag value tau 
% suitable for the given data. Usually tau1=0 and tau2=1 will do, but this is strongly data dependent.
% Therefore, as an extension we developed the TDSEP (Temporal Decorrelation) algorithm, which
% uses _several_ correlation matrices and finds an approximate joint diagonalizer of this 
% matrix set (see Cardosos papers [2] for more details on joint diagonalization)
% See the references below for a description of the TDSEP algorithm [3][4].
% 
% The package includes:
% tdsep2.m      separate instantaneous, linear mixtures of independent
%               sources using an eigen-decomposition of correlation matrices 
% cor2.m        compute time-delayed correlation matrices
% ntu.m         normalize (mixing) matrix to unity (diagonal elements ==1)
% perf.m        evaluate separation performance 
%               by comparing the _estimated_ and the _true_ mixing matrix
% norm_it.m     normalize (mixing) matrix (column vector length =1, e.g. norm(C(:,k),2)==1) 
% sort_norm.m   sort components according to their euclidian norm
% jdiag.m       joint diagonalization of several matrices by J.F. Cardoso
% fischdon.mat  acoustic demo signals (speech and music, 10 sec., sample rate 8kHz)
% sep_demo.m    test routine; run this for a demonstration of blind source separation
