function [SIR,variance]=perf(C,A)
%[SIR,variance]=perf(C,A)
%
%  computes the distance of matrices C and A 
%  ignoring permutation and scaling of columns
%  used to evaluate the separation error
%  SIR = Signal to Interference Ratio  
%              x = A*s
%    u= inv(C)*x = inv(C)*A*s = P*D*s,
%  where P is a permutation and D is a diagonal matrix
